### Problem Statement
American news outlets rarely discuss events occurring around the world. After conducting a global survey, the Pew Research Center discovered that the global median said, "they follow news about their country (86%) or city and town (78%) closely, compared with fewer than six-in-ten who say the same when it comes to news about other countries generally (57%)‚Äù (Mitchell 2018). This understanding presents the problem that there is a substantial demographic that is ignorant to world events that could potentially impact their country. Furthermore, this evident ignorance allows people to be dismissive and naive to heinous acts such as genocides and oppression within other countries. This is dangerous because as global citizens, being unable to recognize signs of oppression from governments in other countries can lead to a downward spiral. Our aim is to educate world citizens on human rights issues, violations, and changes in all countries.
