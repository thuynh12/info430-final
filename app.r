        (86%) or city and town (78%) closely,compared with fewer than six-in-ten who say the  
        same when it comes to news about other countries generally (57%)\". This presents a  
        problem because it forms a demographic that becomes ignorant to world events that   
        have the potential to impact their country. Without the ability to make informed
